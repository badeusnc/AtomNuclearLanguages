Repository for custom Atom text editor languages for common nuclear software.  

Languages are currently quite simple, but could be expanded to do fancier stuff.  
Right now most language modules support comments and basic keyword highlighting.  

These language-CODE directories need to be in the appropriate location for atom
to read them.  This is normally /Users/username/github/ on a mac.
